## Script (Voiceover + Visual Notes)

**0–5s — Hook**

VO:  
“Tired of calling five different people just to fix one thing at home?”

VISUAL:  
Quick cuts: ringing phone, unread messages, someone scrolling endless search results. Then a simple ProBridge interface appears.

---

**5–15s — Introduce ProBridge ABQ**

VO:  
“ProBridge ABQ gives you one place to get a trusted local pro for home projects — handyman, cleaning, moving, furniture assembly, and more.”

VISUAL:  
Map of Albuquerque, icons for handyman, cleaning, moving, assembly appearing over different neighborhoods.

---

**15–30s — How it works (3 steps)**

VO:  
“Here’s how it works:

Step one: Tell us what you need and where in ABQ.  
Step two: We match you with a vetted local pro and a clear, upfront price.  
Step three: You approve, pay securely, and your pro shows up.”

VISUAL:  
Simple three-step animation:  
1. Short form being filled.  
2. Quote card with single total.  
3. Calendar + pro arriving at door.

---

**30–45s — Why it’s better**

VO:  
“No more phone tag, no more guessing the price, and no more wondering if someone will actually show up. ProBridge checks the details so you don’t have to.”

VISUAL:  
Split screen: chaotic DIY search on left, calm ProBridge flow on right.

---

**45–55s — Social proof / reassurance (light)**

VO:  
“Designed for real life in ABQ — from small fixes and moves to full cleanings and repairs.”

VISUAL:  
Short montage: a cleaner at work, a handyman mounting a TV, small move-in boxes.

---

**55–60s — Call to action**

VO:  
“Have a project in Albuquerque? Go to ProBridge ABQ, tell us what you need once, and we’ll take it from there.”

ON-SCREEN TEXT:  
“Request a local pro now”

## Notes for Production

- Keep the tone practical and calm.
- Show ABQ context subtly: scenery, neighborhoods, hints of local architecture.
- Prioritize clarity of the three steps and the single-price concept.
